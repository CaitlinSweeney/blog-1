                    <p>All I did my first year at Vogue was Xerox. Design is a series of creative choices - it's a collaborative effort, an evolutionary process. You choose your fabrics depending upon what you want to say, then you work with mills to get those fabrics. Through the process, you realize what you want it to be. I always loved aesthetics. Not particularly fashion, but an idea of beauty. If you cut a painter's hands off, he'd still feel the urge to pick up a brush. Success isn't about the end result, it's about what you learn along the way.</p>

                    <h1>Section Title 2</h1>
                    <p>Today, I'm very happy about myself, because I realized my dreams. I learned how to understand what people want. I believe in comfort. If you don't feel comfortable in your clothes, it's hard to think of anything else. </p>

                    <p> Men don't want another man to look at their woman because they don't know how to handle it. I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style. It's really easy to get colors right. It's really hard to get black - and neutrals - right. Black is certainly a color but it's also an illusion.</p>

                    <h1>Section Title 3</h1>
                    <p> I think there is something about luxury - it's not something people need, but it's what they want. It really pulls at their heart. I didn't consider myself a fashion designer at all at the time of punk. I was just using fashion as a way to express my resistance and to be rebellious. I came from the country, and by the time I got to London, I considered myself to be very stupid.</p>

                    <ol>
                    <li>If you wear clothes that don't suit you, you're a fashion victim. You have to wear clothes that make you look better.</li>
                    <li>Elegance isn't solely defined by what you wear. It's how you carry yourself, how you speak, what you read.</li>
                    <li>What you wear is how you present yourself to the world, especially today when human contacts go so fast. Fashion is instant language.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>It was my ambition to understand the world I live in. Clothes can transform your mood and confidence. In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish. For me, art is about learning and about living with people. It's alive.</p>
